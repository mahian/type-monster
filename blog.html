                Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to the Documents local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed. Local storage has four methods : setItem(), getItem(), removeItem(), clear()<br><br>
                Session Storage: Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. Session storage has four methods : setItem(), getIteam(), removeItem(), clear()

            <p class="para">
                Global scope — Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. <br><br>
                Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it's declared.

            <h2 class="title">3. How does javascript event loop works?</h2>
            <p class="para">JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.The event loop got its name because of how it's usually implemented, which usually resembles. queue.waitForMessage() waits synchronously for a message to arrive. <br><br>
            This offers some nice properties when reasoning about your program, including the fact that whenever a function runs, it cannot be preempted and will run entirely before any other code runs (and can modify data the function manipulates). This differs from C, for instance, where if a function runs in a thread, it may be stopped at any point by the runtime system to run some other code in another thread.In web browsers, messages are added anytime an event occurs and there is an event listener attached to it. If there is no listener, the event is lost. So a click on an element with a click event handler will add a message — likewise with any other event.

            <h2 class="title">4. How many time we get undefined in javascript?</h2>
            <p class="para">
                You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. In the above example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.
